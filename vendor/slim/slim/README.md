Slim is a PHP micro-framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs.

## Installation

It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install Slim.

```bash
$ composer require slim/slim:4.0.0-alpha
```

This will install Slim and all required dependencies. Slim requires PHP 7.1 or newer.

## Choose a PSR-7 Implementation & ServerRequest Creator

Before you can get up and running with Slim you will need to choose a PSR-7 implementation that best fits your application. A few notable ones:
- [Slim-Psr7](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7) - This is the Slim Framework projects PSR-7 implementation.
- [Nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) & [Nyholm/psr7-server](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server) - This is the fastest, strictest and most lightweight implementation at the moment
- [Guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7) & [http-interop/http-factory-guzzle](https://github.com/http-interop/http-factory-guzzle) - This is the implementation used by the Guzzle Client. It is not as strict but adds some nice functionality for Streams and file handling. It is the second fastest implementation but is a bit bulkier
- [zend-diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) - This is the Zend implementation. It is the slowest implementation of the 3.


## Slim-Http Decorators

[Slim-Http](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Http) is a set of decorators for any PSR-7 implementation that we recommend is used with Slim Framework.
To install the Slim-Http library simply run the following command:

```bash
composer require slim/http
```

The `ServerRequest` and `Response` object decorators are automatically detected and applied by the internal factories. If you have installed Slim-Http and wish to turn off automatic object decoration you can use the following statements:
```php
<?php

use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;
use Slim\Factory\ServerRequestCreatorFactory;

AppFactory::setSlimHttpDecoratorsAutomaticDetection(false);
ServerRequestCreatorFactory::setSlimHttpDecoratorsAutomaticDetection(false);

$app = AppFactory::create();

...
```

## Hello World using AppFactory with PSR-7 auto-detection
In order for auto-detection to work and enable you to use `AppFactory::create()` and `App::run()` without having to manually create a `ServerRequest` you need to install one of the following implementations:
- [Slim-Psr7](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Psr7) - Install using `composer require slim/psr7`
- [Nyholm/psr7](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7) & [Nyholm/psr7-server](https://github.com/Nyholm/psr7-server) - Install using `composer require nyholm/psr7 nyholm/psr7-server`
- [Guzzle/psr7](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7) & [http-interop/http-factory-guzzle](https://github.com/http-interop/http-factory-guzzle) - `composer require guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle`
- [zend-diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros) - Install using `zendframework/zend-diactoros`

```php
<?php
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Slim\Factory\AppFactory;
use Slim\Middleware\ErrorMiddleware;

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

// Instantiate App
$app = AppFactory::create();

// Add error middleware
$responseFactory = $app->getResponseFactory();
$errorMiddleware = new ErrorMiddleware($app->getCallableResolver(), $responseFactory, true, true, true);
$app->add($errorMiddleware);

// Add route
$app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, $args) {
    $name = $args['name'];
    $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");
    return $response;
});

$app->run();
```

You may quickly test this using the built-in PHP server:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Going to http://localhost:8000/hello/world will now display "Hello, world".

For more information on how to configure your web server, see the [Documentation](https://www.slimframework.com/docs/start/web-servers.html).

## Tests
To execute the test suite, you'll need to install all development dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/slimphp/Slim
$ composer install
$ composer test
```
